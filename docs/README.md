# Origami Definition Language (_Origami_)
Origami Definition Language is a design-specific language created to textually define Origami folding instructions and is designed to be easily parseable by both human and machine.

**The language is still being specified. Please have a look at the issues (and especially [Issue #1](https://github.com/padarom/origami/issues/1)) if you want to know more or contribute.**

To distinguish Origami (the art of paper folding) from _Origami_ (the Origami Definition Language), the latter will be written in cursive for the purposes of this and other documents relating to the language.
